				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">The thing that pushed humanity forward into an 
				entirely new era was the ability to record our thoughts. Depending on your perspective, the first examples 
				of this could be cave paintings, a physical manifestation and recording of the experiences that those 
				humans had. Later on, we used stencils to make imprints in mud slabs. Then came papyrus, and so on.<br>
				<br>

				Writing things down is an incredibly useful tool for not only remembering but learning as well. Something 
				magical happens when paper is brought to pen. The physicality of it, the intention lets our brains know 
				that what we are going to write is important (given that we also hold this belief) and that we should 
				commit it to memory. <br>
				<br>
				It would be a waste to overlook this aspect of learning and naively believe that we could simply 
				remember everything we need to. If you sat through an hour-long lecture without taking notes, would 
				you be able to reteach that very lecture to another person? Chances are the answer is no. You still might 
				not be able to if you took notes, but given enough time and studying of those notes, you would be able to.
				<br><br>
				Now that we've established that it's pretty important to take notes, what's the best way to do it? The answer 
				varies from person to person, time to time, and situation to situation. I've gone through many different 
				phases of note-taking because I required different things for my learning. <br><br>
				
				For example, this is my current lecture-watching routine. First, I read over the PowerPoint before 
				watching the lecture so I have some idea of what's going to happen. I then watch the lecture without taking 
				notes, trying to absorb everything I can. After that, I revisit the PowerPoint and take notes on everything 
				that was important. <br><br>
				
				My system won't work for everybody and it would be counterproductive to force yourself into my system if 
				it didn't work for you. So, better than that is to focus on key ideas and adapt your system to keep 
				them at the forefront. Here are the ideas:</p>
				
				<ol class="article_body_text">
					<li>Intention - If you watch a lecture with the intention of daydreaming, you'll daydream. You need to 
					be very aware of what you are there to accomplish and remind yourself of why you're studying in the 
					first place.</li>


					<li>Retention - The more you practice something, the better you'll be at it. Similarly, the more you 
					see something, the likelier you are to learn that thing. Try to incorporate repetition, be it through 
					flashcards or restudying after a few days. However, know that simply re-reading something over and over 
					again can become counterproductive after some time, so don't "overlearn".</li>


					<li>Organization - A consistent system is necessary to know what's going on and where. I use colored pens 
					to mark my headings (black), notes (purple), sub-notes (orange), examples (blue), and other (green). I also 
					leave a few lines of space between each blurb to keep my pages flexible for future additions and to also 
					give myself places to mentally breathe.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">Notes are too powerful a tool to overlook. Get yourself 
				a notebook, some nice pens, and get to writing.
