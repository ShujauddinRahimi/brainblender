				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">What if I told you that a new and
				revolutionary drug could do incredible things like: improve your memory, help you learn better,
				decrease your risk of disease, help you lose weight, and improve your quality of life overall?
				Undoubtedly, I’d have your interest, right?<br>
				<br>
				Sleep is tragically one of the most important aspects of our lives that we regularly deprive
				ourselves of. How often do you skip a meal for the sake of getting work done, or to spend a
				little more time on Netflix or YouTube? My guess is never, and yet we never hesitate to sleep
				two hours less to make sure we get our paper done by 2 am.<br>
				<br>
				We spend hours cooking and preparing meals for ourselves to enjoy and yet we can’t spend a
				single hour away from our phones before bed to make sure we enjoy sleep. Our society has been
				founded upon the principle of an everlasting hunger for success, one that glosses over the
				little things that make life meaningful and one that won’t wait for you to get your full
				night’s sleep. While you’re getting your beauty sleep, someone else is up at 4 am grinding
				away, so why don’t you get up and go after it? But what’s the impact of such a way of living?
				Is it really the best way to live?<br>
				<br>
				What we know for a fact is this: consistently poor sleep leads to a shorter life and
				drastically reduces the quality of that shorter life. Sleeping less than six or seven hours a
				night more than doubles your risk of cancer, greatly increases your chance of gaining weight,
				and increases your risk of heart disease. For the time you are awake, you experience a decrease
				in motor function performance, your hormones are not being released properly, and your capacity
				to remember and learn new things is reduced.<br>
				<br>
				Maybe you’re not worried about sleeping well now because you have more important things to do
				and you’ll sleep more later in life; well, “insufficient sleep is a key lifestyle factor
				determining whether or not you will develop Alzheimer’s disease” - Matthew Walker, “Why We
				Sleep”. Every hour, a person in the United States, unfortunately, dies in a traffic accident
				caused by fatigue-related error. The list of damaging side effects from a lack of proper sleep
				is terrifyingly long and we have still so much more to discover, which begs the question: why
				don’t we sleep better?<br>
				<br>
				It’s a simple question with a complicated answer. It starts with our basic instinctual desire
				to get more done throughout the day. Even when we are wasting time, by bingeing Netflix at 3
				am, the caveman or cavewoman part of our brain thinks that there is something helpful or useful
				happening, otherwise, you wouldn’t be doing it.<br>
				<br>
				We give ourselves a bigger plate than we can handle and end up with the dilemma of finding time
				where there is none. The solution that we have culturally deemed not only acceptable but often
				times admirable is to cut sleep short. We have no problem with cutting off two hours of our
				recommended eight because you still get 75% of a full night’s sleep, right? Well, our sleep
				cycle is a nuanced system that has two modes of sleep: REM and nREM, where both are equally
				valuable.<br>
				<br>
				We get lots of nREM sleep during the beginning of the night and it shifts toward being more REM
				heavy throughout our sleep cycle. So, cutting off two hours doesn’t cut 25% off, it cuts 60-90
				percent of all your REM sleep, which is the time when you dream and your brain consolidates the
				memories of the previous day. Having trouble remembering your dreams? Maybe, now you know
				why.<br>
				<br>
				After we wake up from our catfish of a sleep, we are unsurprisingly tired and lack the ability
				to function at a normal level, so what do we do? Go back to sleep, right? Who am I kidding, you
				brew a cup of coffee or head to Starbucks to get your daily fill of caffeine, the most widely
				used stimulant in the world. When consumed after 12pm for most people, caffeine delays sleep
				onset and is typically misinterpreted as insomnia, inviting another set of drugs used to help
				bring on sleep. You trudge through the rest of your day hopped up on a false sense of alertness
				and the cycle repeats itself yet again.<br>
				<br>
				So, what can you do to end this cycle and get your nightly fill of quality sleep?</p>


				<ol class="article_body_text">
					<li>Stick to a schedule. Be in bed at the same time every night as regularly as you can,
					giving yourself enough time to fall asleep in the first place (around 15-30 minutes) and then
					enough time to stay asleep (7-9 hours). You’ll find that as you become more regular, you might
					wake up at the time you need to automatically without the need for an alarm.</li>


					<li>Avoid blue light as much as you can for the hour before bed and do activities that relax
					you. Read a book or listen to some music. Don’t make it too interesting though, you might end
					up not wanting to sleep.</li>


					<li>Try to avoid laying down throughout the day or using your bed for anything but sleeping. I
					find that by the end of the night, I’m dying to be able to just relax on my bed and it’s like
					a nice reward for getting my work done throughout the day.</li>


					<li>Don’t exercise after 4 hours before your bedtime and don’t eat or drink after 3 hours
					before. Exercising delays sleep, eating increases your blood sugar and engages your
					metabolism, and water might cause you to pee throughout the night.</li>


					<li>Don’t drink coffee after 12 pm and if you can, try to stay away from it in general.
					Caffeine is, in fact, a drug and it has its own set of withdrawal symptoms like headache,
					fatigue, anxiety, among others. Instead, drink a glass of water after you wake up and do
					something active, like going for a walk or doing some stretches.</li>


					<li>Naps are healthy for you and are a part of your natural sleep rhythm. Studies have found
					that nappers have a better capacity to learn and remember because they offload temporary
					memory to long term memory during the nap. Take a 15-45 minute nap before 3 pm and see how you
					feel.</li>


					<li>Don’t be afraid to try new things. Maybe you normally sleep at 1 am but you fall asleep
					the best at 9 pm. You’ll never know until you try! Experiment with different routines and
					times until you find the one that works best for you and don’t be afraid to try things that
					seem “out of character” for you.</li>
