				<h2 style="text-align: center">Who are you? Who will you be?</h2>

				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">From the first time we ever looked in a mirror, 
				we've had some sort of idea of who we are. Maybe we see ourselves as our physical characteristics: tall, short,
				 skinny, chubby, etc. Maybe we see ourselves as the things we do: athlete, student, doctor, lawyer, nurse. The 
				 funny thing about identity is that the longer you go on being "yourself", the harder it is to become someone 
				 you're not: the person you want to be. <br><br>
				 
				It's very difficult for us to think of ourselves living any life other than the one we're living. If someone has 
				been an artist for the past 35 years, it might be completely unfathomable to them that they could be a successful 
				mathematician, despite not being any less capable of being a mathematician than she was when she started her 
				art career. <br><br>
				
				The truth is, we like constancy. We don't want to change very much because it would mean that we'd have to learn 
				how to be someone else. So, when it comes time to change our bad habits, form good ones, and clean up our act,
				 our subconscious identity goes into a defensive mode. It influences us to use the word "try" rather than "do". 
				It tells us that it's okay when we fail our self-improvement goals, that we were never meant for that sort of thing 
				anyways. To become better people, the people we want to be, we have to mute this voice in our heads. <br><br>
				
				Self-improvement starts with the word "self" for a reason: you must know what it is you're trying to improve. So, how can we do that?</p>
				
				<ol class="article_body_text">
					<li>Write down your habits - Put pen to paper and factually outline what you do, good and bad. Put a + next to 
					habits you are proud of and a - next to ones that you're not.</li>


					<li>Write down who you want to be - What do you want to change about yourself? Why?</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">Once you have an idea of who you are and who you want to be 
				down on paper, everything becomes much clearer and easier. Now comes time for convincing. Put into practice actions and 
				statements that fall in line with not just who you <i>want</i> to be, but who you <i>will</i> be.</p>
				
				<ol class="article_body_text">
					<li>For example, if you want to be a writer, stop thinking "I'm trying to be a writer". Think, "I am a writer".</li>

					<li>Do things a writer would do. Write every day. Then write more. Look to see what other writers do.</li>
					
					<li>Find an instructor or mentor. Few successful people (note that success does not equal famous) made it entirely on their own, 
					and having an instructor to help guide you in practice and in identity will be very beneficial.</li>
					
					<li>Affirm to yourself that you are capable of doing whatever you want to. Humans are incredibly powerful in that we can set 
					our mind on something and work endlessly to achieve it. You're no different.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">Changing your identity is no easy task. There's plenty more I could write about it. But 
				at the end of the day, tips and tricks will do very little when your defensive self-identity kicks into self-preservation mode. In times like those, 
				your will and yearning for a better self will have to carry you through the tough times.</p>
