				<h2 style="text-align: center">Your Surroundings Mean More</h2>

				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">We often think that we are more adaptable 
				than we really are. We've inhabited every nook and cranny of the Earth, dominated sky, land, and 
				sea, and have come so far. But, in reality, we are more-so creatures of habit than creatures of 
				adventure.<br>
				<br>
				Would your favorite food taste the same if it were eaten in the bathroom? Probably not! Would 
				NBA players be able to play to their potential if instead of hardwood they had a grass court? 
				Probably not! Experiences have their own homes in our mind, built on sights, smells, feelings, 
				and everything else that they come with.<br>
				<br>
				Now, I'm not insinuating that we shouldn't do anything out of the ordinary. Rather, I'm saying that 
				for processes that we repeat often or are important, we should try our best to keep all controllable conditions
				the same. We do well with familiarity and a lack of surprises. Our brains are built to be wary 
				of changes, because changes can often mean danger.<br>
				<br>
				When it comes to learning, we should avoid switching things up too drastically or allowing ourselves 
				us to be subject to poor conditions. Here's a quick list of what you should keep in mind:<br></p>
				
				<ol class="article_body_text">
					<li>Mood - If you're angry or upset and you can still focus on learning, you might be superhuman. 
					For the rest of us mere mortals, trying to learn while feeling more emotional than normal probably 
					won't work. If you're going through some things, take a break and do something relaxing, whatever that 
					is for you. Try again later.</li>


					<li>Position - Some of us learn better sitting. Some, standing. Others, upside-down. Whatever it is, 
					listen to your mind and body and make changes accordingly if they're necessary. Otherwise, keep it 
					consistent. If you want to lay down immediately after sitting (and are a sitting learner), then maybe 
					you're tired and shouldn't be learning at that time.</li>


					<li>Time - Personally, I do my best learning early in the day. I eat my figuratives frogs first
					 thing in the morning so that I don't have to worry about it later on. I would not do well if I 
					 tried to watch a lecture at 11 pm.</li>


					<li>Noise - Most of us like things quiet when we're learning, and any annoying sounds can 
					quickly throw us out of the flowstates we work so hard to get into. </li>
				</ol>
				
				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">Beyond your physical environment, your mental environment has a big impact on your state of mind. The 
				people you surround yourself with in your day-to-day greatly affect how you see yourself, how you 
				gauge where you are in life, etc. Being surrounded by a bunch of aspirational hard-workers is a very 
				different experience from being surrounded by lazy bums. <br>
				<br>
				Take your environment into careful consideration and make the changes you need to become a better 
				learner.</p>
