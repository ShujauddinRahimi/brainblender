				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">Doing anything while distracted is hard. Multitasking 
				doesn't really work because our brains aren't computers, we don't have multi-core processors that let us work on a 
				few things efficiently at once (though we still <i>kind of</i> have something like that with our unconscious actions), so
				 we shouldn't be surprised when we get C's and B's on homework we did while watching TV. <br><br>
				 
				The best thing we can do for ourselves while trying to learn something is to reduce the outside (and inside) chatter. 
				If it doesn't have to do with what's at hand, forget about it. If you've got music playing in the background and you need 
				laser-focus, turn it off. I "work better" with music on when doing mundane tasks but it distracts me from anything 
				that requires actual attention. <br><br>
				
				If you're constantly surrounded by a noisy environment, try these things: </p>
				
				<ol class="article_body_text">
					<li>Move! - If you're house is always noisy because you've got 35 people living in it like I do, take a trip 
					to your library or school campus to get your work done. Maybe there's a room in your house that is a lot 
					quieter than anywhere else. Try different locations and see what works best. If this isn't possible then...</li>


					<li>Muff em! - Wear noise-cancelling headphones (if you have them/can afford them), earplugs, or anything else 
					that helps block out sound for you. You might not be able to control all the outside noise, but you can control 
					how much of it gets to you. If it's <b>still</b> too loud...</li>


					<li>Ask! If the noise that is bothering you is man-made (like a noisy family), ask them to keep it down for a 
					set time period so that you can study. This works two-fold by creating a calm environment and giving you a deadline 
					to finish some meaningful work by.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">There are definitely many ways to avoid working in a noisy environment 
				and it isn't something that you should put up with. Give your brain the best conditions you can for it to work its best 
				when learning. Now that we've got outside chatter solved, let's take a look at <i>inner</i> chatter.</p>
				
				<h3 class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">Inner Chatter</h3>
				
				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">I'm someone with lots of inner chatter. My mind is always racing 
				about what I have to do next, how I can do it in the best way, etc., etc. I have found a few methods to give myself the 
				mental space and comfort I need to put all that aside and work efficiently.</p>
				
				<ol class="article_body_text">
					<li>A to-do list - I used to not use one and I would use up a lot of mental capacity just keeping track of what I 
					needed to get done. Now, I know that everything I need to do has its own place and time and I don't have to worry 
					about conflicts or whether I'm forgetting something. If ever I feel anxious, I just look at my calendar and take 
					a few deep breaths.</li>


					<li>My phone - When it's time to work, I chuck my phone across my room onto my bed, face down. If I don't, I'll drop 
					everything and immediately pick up my phone at the sound of a notification ding and waste <b>lots</b> of time.</li>


					<li>Pomodoro - The Pomodoro technique is basically setting a 25-minute and doing as much meaningful work during that 
					time period as possible. I have trouble doing this one because I like getting into a flow and busting out all the work 
					that I need to, but it's something I should do more often to stay fresh and not burn out.</li>
					
					<li>Meditate! - If I've got lots of things going on up there, I just take a few minutes to sit and breathe intentionally,
					 clearing space in my head. Sometimes I even visualize my brain as a desktop and dragging all my thoughts into the recycle bin.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p class="article_body_text" style="text-align: left">I hope at least one of these tactics helps you be a little less distracted!</p>
